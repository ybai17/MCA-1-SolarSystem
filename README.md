These are files that comprise the MCA 1 (Mini-game Coding Assigmnent) project I did for my CS 5540 Game Programming class.

The Unity project involves having a basic 3D representation of the Solar System with 8 planets revolving around the Sun in the center. You can press Space to toggle between zooming in and also revolving around the Sun and zooming back out.

This repository contains the essential files and folders that make up the Unity project.
